## Inspiration
We originally had this idea because we all feel we have trouble managing our time, but we were aware of the many general solutions  for that. Our CAPS teacher was able to push us towards something centered around mental health, and it was originally going to be a reminder system for dementia that could be managed by a caretaker; however, we felt that would be too depressing to present and too ambitious to create in 36 hours, but we still liked our idea of a reminder system, and found we all had trouble managing our prescriptions as well as many others so landed on this idea.  
## What it does
We built a web app that schedules automatic reminder to order and pick up your prescriptions to reduce the stress of being without them.
## How we built it
Our project was built using a combination of JavaScript, React, Python, HTML, Propel Auth, and a .tech domain. We chose JavaScript, React, and HTML for front-end development, and Python for the back-end. PropelAuth was used to accurately and safely authenticate user credentials during login. We also took advantage of many react libraries; however, we mainly focused on react-bootstrap, react-router-dom, and big-react-calendar.
## Challenges we ran into
We encountered several challenges along the way. One significant hurdle was setting up JavaScript, running the files properly, and using Git for collaboration in VSCode. big-react-calendar was a big issue we had, being that its creator clearly does not want people to use his application and hides his source code for examples and has broken source code on his github.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Sam:

Nick: I'm really proud that I was able to actually see a project all the way through. I'm also pretty impressed at myself for learning so much so quickly, as it usually take me a pretty long time to pick up on things in general, especially with programming.

## What we learned
Sam:

Nick: I learned the process of actually finishing something and how difficult that can be, and expanded my knowledge of React, specifically with useState and bootstrap, which I feel very confident in now. I that while I may have not learned something entirely new to me, the expanse of my preexisting knowledge was so vast that it outweighs anything else I could've learned this weekend.

## What's next for Medplanner
In the future, we plan to make the web app more aesthetically pleasing as well as the ability for users to buy prescribed medications and have it shipped to their house as soon as possible. Medical information is very private so security is something in the future that we will need to be properly solved. We could use Propel Auth Api key support or the Django (our backend framework) auth module to authenticate every request but as of now it only assigns information to the user.
